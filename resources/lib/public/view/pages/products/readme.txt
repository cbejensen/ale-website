A note about the PREMIUM EQUIPMENT page:

This page loads portions of its content with Javascript. When a user
clicks one of the product categories, the page adds/swaps out the
product content with Ajax. I'm using the HTML5 History API to modify
the URL for such events such that any page state will be accessible
via a unique URL.
