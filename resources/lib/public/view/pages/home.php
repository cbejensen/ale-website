			<img src="" alt="">
			<p>"We purchased a Tecan robotic liquid handler and a PlateLoc plate sealer
			through Atlantic Lab Equipment when we expanded our next-generation sequencing
			capabilities in our lab. Our decision to entrust ALE with our equipment needs
			was in part due to the cost savings but also because of the extensive technical
			support services they offer. With complex instrumentation like robotic liquid
			handlers, having access to highly trained support specialists like Jenn at ALE
			is critical. They have made good on their commitment to our technical needs by
			being ever ready to assist us with questions that invariably arise."</p>

			<p>"Atlantic Lab Equipment has drastically improved the operational workflow
			of our lab, specializing in Toxicology, by fully automating the sample preparation
			process. Now our lab is able to stand out in this very competitive market by
			committing to a shorter turnaround time. ALE has provided excellent support in
			the areas of competitive pricing, excellent quality of equipment purchased, and have
			stood behind their word in making necessary repairs to meet the promised quality.
			Their work, commitment, and integrity have been a major factor in my recommendation
			of ALE to be a solid and reliable vendor and experts in their field of business."</p>

			<p>"The people at Atlantic Lab Equipment are extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and
			easy to work with. We were able to do an on-site inspection of the instrument we
			were interested in purchasing, and when we arrived we found the instrument already
			cleaned, properly maintained, and running demo experiments. It made the evaluation
			much easier and really strengthened the confidence we had in buying a used liquid
			handler. One year later, the instrument is still running great, we saved thousands
			of dollars, and we now have a great relationship with a quality company in ALE."</p>
