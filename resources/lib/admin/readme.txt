This directory contains the content/inventory management system. 
The modules within are responsible for different functionalities of this 
integrated system.

Lists - The "Lists" module enables the display of various data into lists, 
and therefore enables that data's manipulation. This is used, for example, 
when editing or creating ads or ad pages to be displayed on the site. It's 
also used to look up/edit information about items in our inventory.

Inventory - The "Inventory" module is used for processing of the inventory. 
When equipment arrives, this module is used to collect the relevant data and 
log it into the database. It's also used when inventory data needs to be 
exported into various spreadsheet formats.

QB - The "QB" module deals with the integration of the inventory system with 
our QuickBooks files.
