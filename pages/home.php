					<blockquote>“We purchased a Tecan robotic liquid handler and a
						PlateLoc plate sealer through Atlantic Lab Equipment in 2014 when
						we expanded our next-generation sequencing capabilities in our
						lab. Our decision to entrust ALE with our equipment needs was in
						part due to the cost savings but also because of the extensive
						technical support services they offer. With complex
						instrumentation like robotic liquid handlers, having access to
						highly trained support specialists like Jenn at ALE is critical.
						They have made good on their commitment to our technical needs by
						being ever ready to assist us with questions that invariably
						arise."</blockquote>

					<blockquote>“Atlantic Lab Equipment has drastically improved the
						operational workflow of our lab, specializing in Toxicology, by
						fully automating the sample preparation process. Now our lab is
						able to stand out in this very competitive market by committing to
						a shorter turnaround time. ALE has provided excellent support in
						the areas of competitive pricing, excellent quality of equipment
						purchased, and have stood behind their word in making necessary
						repairs to meet the promised quality. Their work, commitment, and
						integrity have been a major factor in my recommendation of ALE to
						be a solid and reliable vendor and experts in their field of
						business.”</blockquote>

					<blockquote>“The people at Atlantic Lab Equipment are extremely
						helpful, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. We were able to do
						an on-site inspection of the instrument we were interested in
						purchasing, and when we arrived we found the instrument already
						cleaned, properly maintained, and running demo experiments. It
						made the evaluation much easier and really strengthened the
						confidence we had in buying a used liquid handler. One year later,
						the instrument is still running great, we saved thousands of
						dollars, and we now have a great relationship with a quality
						company in ALE.”</blockquote>
